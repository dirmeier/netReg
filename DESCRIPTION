Description: netReg fits linear regression models using network-penalization.
    Graph prior knowledge, in the form of biological networks, is being
    incorporated into the loss function of the linear model. 
    The networks describe biological relationships such as co-regulation or dependency of the same
    transcription factors/metabolites/etc. yielding a part sparse and part
    smooth solution for coefficient profiles.
