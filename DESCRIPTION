Description: netReg fits linear regression models using network-penalization.
    Graph prior knowledge, in the form of biological networks, is being 
    incorporated into the likelihood of the linear model. The networks describe 
    biological relationships such as co-regulation or dependency of the same 
    transcription factors/metabolites/etc. yielding a part sparse and part
    smooth solution for coefficient profiles.
